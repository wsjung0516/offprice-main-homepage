          <p>
            This program is a website for clothing closeout sales. It enables
            sellers to sell their inventory in bulk quantities. Wholesale or
            closeout sales businesses can use this website to select and
            purchase items. The program allows users to store selected items in
            a separate cart and initiate transactions with the sellers by
            verifying the seller's information provided with the product. The
            program focuses on the following considerations:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>
              Fast search: Ensuring users can quickly find their desired items
              among a large number of products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easy product registration for sellers: Designing a user-friendly
              interface for product registration without the need for extensive
              instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Responsive mode: Applying responsive design to enable easy product
              registration and browsing on any hardware device. It particularly
              allows direct photo uploads from mobile devices.
            </li>

          <p class="text-2xl mt-8">Reasons for development:</p>
          <ol class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
            <li>
              Started developing the website due to the recommendation of an
              acquaintance, as there are many sellers with a large inventory
              in the LA jobber market. The goal was to create a website for
              these sellers to sell closeout products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Initially, thorough market research was necessary, but there
              was a lack of information on wholesale and closeout sales.
              Therefore, the design relied on the experience of some
              small-scale traders.
            </li>
            <li>
              The focus of development was to create a system that is easy
              for sellers to use, rather than prioritizing the buyer's
              perspective. However, there were limitations in obtaining
              sufficient information for this aspect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Therefore, the development was initially based on strategic
              considerations.
            </li>
            <li>
              To commercialize the website, advertising and additional
              development plans would be necessary. However, due to the lack
              of resources to compete with existing competitors large company such as
              "Faire" and "Fashion-Go", the development was temporarily halted.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="text-2xl mt-8">Development period:</p>

            <li>3.5 months (2023-03-01 to 2023-06-15)</li>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-8">Technologies applied in development:</p>

              <ol  class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                <li>
                  Angular: Developed using the latest version, incorporating
                  both standalone and SSR (Server Side Rendering) capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nestjs: Chosen as the back-end technology due to its
                  similarities with Angular in terms of structure, making it
                  easy to apply for those familiar with Angular. It is also
                  highly scalable and suitable for large-scale projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prisma: Applied as an ORM (Object Relational Model)
                  technology, which is easier to implement compared to TypeORM
                  and provides fast performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Docker: Containerized the front-end and back-end programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kubernetes: Utilized for simplified deployment of the
                  containerized front-end and back-end programs, enabling easy
                  application of CI/CD, continuous monitoring, and self-healing
                  capabilities for stable operations. Ingress and reverse proxy
                  were implemented for Nestjs and Angular.
                </li>
                <li>
                  MySQL: Google Cloud SQL was used for stable data backup,
                  monitoring, and automatic scaling.
                </li>
                <li>Firebase: Implemented for user authentication purposes.</li>
              </ol>
